# TypeWalker

A visitor which walks System.Type objects; useful for building reflection-based utilities.

This library was intended as the basis of a converter, designed to create TypeScript interfaces from Model objects found in C# MVC applications. The idea being, to allow you to link together your server-side code with your client-side code efficiently.
